# Overview

I developed this web app to explore the web framework Django and develop my understanding of databases and backend web development.

This software includes four main parts, first it has a hello world page that I started this project with. 
The second part of my project is the home app which uses a database to populate example projects.
The third part is of my own creation called languages, which uses a database to populate the different programming languages I am learning.
The fourth part is another app called cats where static images are displayed.
